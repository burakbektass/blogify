# blogify
MongoDB / Express / React js / Node js full stack blog application (resource: @codingwithdidem)

Frameworks, libraries and technologies ;

-> MongoDB: No-SQL database (collections, JSON)

-> Express: Node.js framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications.

-> Node.js: For server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services.

-> React.js: For building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

-> Mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data.

-> Redux-thunk: Middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux.
